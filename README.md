Day 4: 50-Day LeetCode Milestone Challenge

Hey connections,

Today, I tackled two interesting problems:

Problem 1: Two Sum (Q1)
- Problem Statement: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.
- Time Complexity: O(n^2)
- Approach:
  - Nested Loop: I used a nested loop to iterate through each pair of numbers to find the two that add up to the target.

 Problem 2: Find Pivot Index (Q724)
- Problem Statement:** Given an array of integers `nums`, calculate the pivot index of this array. The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the right of the index.
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Approach:
  - Prefix Sum Method: I calculated the prefix sum for each element and used it to determine the pivot index.

Stay tuned for daily updates as I continue this exciting challenge!

Happy Coding!
